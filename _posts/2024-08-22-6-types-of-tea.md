<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we gonna touch on about the difference between the 6 basic tea types, whats the difference and how processing affects the final tea taste and appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let just start off by saying that all the six types we gonna talk about today come from camellia sinensis. There are two major varieties used for tea, Chinese tea, Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, and Assam tea, Camellia sinensis var. assamica.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also we are not gonna talk herbal teas or tisanes so anything that does not come from the actual tea plant mentioned before. So we are not talking about peppermint, chamomile "teas" for example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">White</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First on our list is white tea, least processed from the whole list. The minimal processing and the way it is picked makes it one of the most delicate teas out there.  Buds and young leaves are picked before the buds fully open and are still covered with white hairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tea is then quickly and skilfully dried. A mixture of sun withering and then baking at a very low temperature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Because the white it is the only one that is not rolled we usually need longer steep time and higher temperature to extract the flavour.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So to make this tea we only got two steps really:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Withering</strong> -&gt; Drying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because we don't have the fixing step to stop the oxidation from happening, white tea ages beautifully, this also means that white tea will slowly oxidise and taste will become darker and richer closer to a dark tea in couple of years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a Chinese saying about white tea about its ageing:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>One year tea, three years medicine, seven years treasure</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>White tea is probably the only tea type that that the name of the tea relates to picking style not origin, cultivar or area. Here is the rundown of 4 most popular white tea grades:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Baihao Yinzhen / White Hair Silver Needle</em></strong> - Bud only picking very characteristic, distinct look.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Bai Mudan / White Peony</em></strong> - a ratio of bud and few leaves</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Gong Mei / Tribute Eyebrow</em></strong> - mostly leaves, thinner buds usually picked later in the year </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Shou Mei / Longevity Eyebrow</em></strong> - no buds just leaves again later pickings </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So as you can see all the grades differ from each other by what part of the tea plant you get in the cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Yellow</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yellow tea is a a weird one, it is rare and uncommon makes a tiny percentage even if 1% of total tea production in China yet it is classed among the other types. It's production is very similar to green tea with one additional "yellowing step". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yellow tea can again be divided by picking type but we wont get into the details here</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Method:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fixing -&gt; Rolling -&gt; <strong>Yellowing</strong> -&gt; Drying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some of the "most common" yellow teas although all are very rare to be honest and not that much is produced as mentioned before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><em><strong>Junshan Yinzhen</strong> </em>-  a Silver Needle yellow tea.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><em><strong>Huoshan Huangya</strong></em> It is an imperial tribute tea, that dates back to the Ming Dynasty.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Meng Ding Huangya</em></strong> - are yellow tea from Mengding Mountain made from small young buds.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It always worth a try if you can get it, nowadays it is not that hard to get online so look around and try some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Green</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Green tea is a big one, the main goal with the great tea is to stop the oxidation process immediately after plucking. So green tea is unoxidized meaning that the green colour, freshness and appearance of the leaves is locked by a process called fixing or kill-green / sh?q?ng &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Green Tea should be steeped at lowest temperature out of all the six types to avoid bitterness and the temperature is usually kept 80?C to avoid bitterness. </p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that great care needs to be taken when producing green tea to avoid bruising the leaves and starting any oxidation process on leaves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the steps to produce the green tea:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fixing</strong> -&gt; Rolling -&gt; Drying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These steps will differ depending on the location and type of green tea produced. For example in general green teas produced in Japan will be fixed by steaming whereas the Chinese tea will be pan fired. Steaming produces more of a grassy, vegetable green teas while pan fireing creates that toasty / nutty flavours </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other steps can also happen separately or as in case with <strong>Longjing</strong> they can happen all at the same time in a Wok where the leaves are fixed,  they acquire their signature shape when they are pressed down against the how work and dried all at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Same as with white tea because the green tea has little processing it takes a lot of skill to make it "right" and it is harder to "hide" any issues in processing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the list of some popular Green teas although there are a lot of good green teas out there so this list is just a tiny speck in the sea of green tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In China</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Longjing </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Xinyang Maojian </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Taiping Houkui </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Biluochun </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Japan</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Gyokuro </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Sencha </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>H?jicha </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Matcha </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are countless other amazing green teas so try any and you will be amazed how great they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Oolong</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oolong or Wulong is a phonetic transcription of the Chinese characters ?? that mean Dark dragon, this type of tea is semi oxidised anything between 15% to 85% so the bracket is pretty white and the colour and appearance can vary from green like light liqueur to dark like black tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key part of Oolong tea processing is <strong>bruising</strong> and the objective is to create multi layer, complex taste and aroma</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no one size fit all for Oolong and different teas can vary widely in flavour, from sweet and fruity with honey, milk and butter to  woody thick roasted aromas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuyi_Mountains">Wuyi Mountains</a>&nbsp;of northern Fujian, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Hong_Pao">Da Hong Pao</a>, are among the most famous Chinese teas.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So all steps look usually like so:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Withering -&gt; <strong>Bruising</strong> -&gt; Fixing -&gt; Rolling -&gt; Drying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 3 main players in Oolong tea production namely Fujian &amp; Guangdong in China and Taiwan</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the Ollongs to try include</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Da Hong Pao ("Big Red Robe")</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Tieguanyin ("Iron Goddess of Mercy")</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Jin Xuan (Milk Oolong)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ya Shi Dan Cong (Duck shit Oolong)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oolongs are the widest variety and differ so much in taste and appearance that it can take a bit of time to fine tune to what you like or dislike about it but that the beauty of this type of tea and represents the true craftsmanship of tea making and experience to pull out all of these amazing flavour profiles from the tea leaf. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Black  tea is definitely the most common of all types and accounts for 70-80% of global tea production.  The reason is that this is the most common tea used in all ice tea, processed tea drinks, restaurants tea rooms it is the most recognised and used outside of China. It is used most in industrial setting and it is also what you get in tea bags, definitely the most common out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Black tea is "fully oxidised" so we are talking about 90%-95% oxidation</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even tho so far we focused on China black tea is produced all around the world India, Sri Lanka, Uganda, all produce fantastic black tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Black tea is called Red Tea in China because of the colour of the liquor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why we get a big distinction right out the door, because so far with the other tea types we talked only about loose leaf tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With black the we get:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CTC - Crush, Tear, Curl</strong> vs <strong>Loose Leaf</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTC is Industrial process to obliterate tea leaves and turn them into this tea powder dust and little particles that you find in tea bags. The process makes tea useful in industrial setting makes the tea batches more predictable but also lower quality and not something we want to focus too much about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Loose Leaf</strong> Is your usual high grate tea that we want to focus on as with other types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fermentation is a key faze in the black tea production, The goal here is to create ideal environment for mixing the enzymes with the Tea Catechins. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tea is piled up in baskets and increase the humidity in the storage area. The fermentation room usually have the humidifiers blasting moist air around keeping it above 90%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The processing steps would then look something like so:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Withering -&gt; Rolling -&gt; <strong>Fermentation</strong> -&gt; Drying</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some nice black tea's to try include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Jinjunmei</strong>&nbsp;- made from buds only, has sweet, fruity and flowery flavour with a long-lasting  after-taste.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Keemun</strong> - light flavor compared to other stronger black teas.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Lapsang souchong</strong> - typically  smoke-dried over a pinewood fire.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Dianhong</strong> - Yunnan red tea, relatively high-end, gourmet</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Darjeeling</strong> - black tea from India with musky-sweet taste, grows in the foothills of the Himalayas</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High Quality Black teas are great, more sweet less astringent and definitely not what you are you are used to in the tea bags so this is why this tea type is so fun to explore.</p>
