Come with us on an adventure of discovery that a good cup of properly brewed tea can send you on.

Discover the world of **Gong Fu brewing** and **Cha Dao** and once you brew quality loose leaf tea this way you will never go back to using tea bags again.

Depending on what you need, tea can make you calm or give you all the caffeine and replace your morning cup of tea.

You just need to learn how to use it. It's not hard and all-natural; just let tea guide you along and we guarantee you will end up on a **lifetime journey** of self-discovery and **mindfulness**.

Although this brew might feel like the simplest thing, in fact, you only need **leaf**, **water**, and a **cup**. There is so much more to this.

You will end up surprised with the amount of different brews, amount of **experiences**, smells, and **amazing tasting sessions** you will end up with. So stick around and learn all about the world of quality loose leaf tea.

The way of tea can even be your philosophy and way of life as tea can teach you many useful lessons. You can look into Cha Dao for answers.

It can be as formal or as informal as you like; that's the beauty of drinking tea. It's great for grounding and meditation or, on the other hand, your Matcha shots can replace your coffee with their caffeine content. It is totally up to you to create your own story and relationship with this robust and useful leaf.

> "Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves â€“ slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future. Live the actual moment. Only this moment is life."  
> ~ Thich Nhat Hanh
